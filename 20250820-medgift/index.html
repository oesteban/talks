I work in neuroimaging, specifically on structural and functional connectivity, which involves mapping how different parts of the brain interconnect and communicate.

In many ways, these analyses are reminiscent of graph-related machine learning problems—nodes, edges, and so forth—

In broad strokes, this is the MRI-based connectivity analysis pipeline.

Interestingly, it looks like any machine learning pipeline: we acquire data, perform quality control, preprocess it, define features, and then apply statistical modeling to extract insights.

For a deeper dive into the details of the neuroimaging worflow, I've participated in several efforts such as the two references given below.

The pipeline starts with data acquisition, management and quality assurance and control (QA/QC).

My early work on QA/QC applied machine learning to automatically assess MRI images of the brain, and raised awareness over issues like “site effects”—where data from different scanners or labs can systematically vary, much like “batch effects” in genomics.

One key principle in AI is that models are only as good as their data and neuroimaging is no exception.

This is why my group and I have been deeply involved in BIDS, produced version-controlled, machine-readable standard operating procedures, developed comprehensive QA/QC protocols and created ready-to-use applications to detect suboptimal data early.

Next in the pipeline is preprocessing, which transforms raw data into something models can reliably interpret.

For example, it identifies signals of no interest for their cleaning or accounting within modeling.

In neuroimaging, preprocessing also deals with accurately locating signals and objects in space and time, and often the definition of relevant brain regions that focus the analysis.

A decade ago, we might have called it “feature engineering.”

Regardless of the term, it’s crucial: “preprocessing” is now a keyword in job posts at major players like Anthropic, DeepMind, and OpenAI.

Here I'm showing a very much simplified overview of fMRIPrep's design.

Despite it being just "minimal" preprocessing and just one step of the pipeline, its complexity is evident.

Rather than delving into each of these steps, I'll just say that there's a current need to update and improve computer vision algorithms and approaches (segmentation, image registration, dimensionality reduction, etc.) with AI/ML all across the dataflow.

Once data are ready for analysis, we formalize connectivity as undirected acyclic graphs, represented with symmetric matrices.

In the case of structural connectivity, we use diffusion MRI to track pathways of white-matter bundles connecting brain regions.

For functional connectivity we measure synchronized functional MRI signal fluctuations sensitive to the dynamic oxygen content in blood.

I’ve been involved in several works applying structural and functional connectivity.

For instance, in Rodrigue 2021, we explored ML approaches to identify clinical biomarkers.

Unfortunately, we had to conclude that, despite promising data quality and reliability remain insufficient for robust biomarker discovery.

Therefore, although simple on the surface, the workflow is highly-complex and each step introduces potential variability.

Complicating matters further, every lab around the world might use a slightly different pipeline.

Different tools, different parameters—lead to inconsistent results.

This fragmentation hinders progress and precludes between-study comparisons.

The consequence is an acute scarcity of real-world applications of connectivity analyses.

Let's compare to genomics.

Neuroimaging is today in an early stage of standardization akin to genomics at the conclusion of the Human Genome Project in 2003.

One key aspect for the remarkable advance of genomics is precisely the comprehensive standardization process of the pipeline that culminated some 10 years ago.

For that reason, I advocate for replicating this success experience in neuroscience.

On top of all that methodological variability, there’s also inherent unreliability in measuring connectivity from session to session.

If you scan the same participant twice, back-to-back, you can still get different connectivity measurements, indicating limited test-retest reliability.

Despite all these concerns, more than 20 thousand papers were published focusing on functional connectivity and 10 thousand on structural connectivity in 2024, as per Pubmed.

Having deeply focused on the standardization to address analytical variability, in 2020 I started to work on the reliability problem of connectivity analysis.

Tat that moment, I identified that the neuroimaging community was lacking an ultra-dense, calibration-grade dataset to address the problem.

With the support of an Ambizione project, I launched the Human Connectome Phantom project.

The idea is to have a single subject—myself—scanned intensively within a very short time window to minimize brain changes (and hence, serve as a "phantom" reference).

The dataset needed to combine sophisticated functional and structural MR acquisitions, and a wealth of physiological tracking.

The study was accepted in October 2023 as a Stage 1 Registered Report at Nature Methods.

The registered report, data collection, and the research was carried out by a large team, with the outstanding role of the Ph.D. student funded by the Ambizione (Celine Provins), and is accessible with the QR code.

By pre-registering, we locked in our hypotheses and methods up front and addressed design issues raised by three reviewers before data collection started.

Registered Reports reduce biases and ensure transparency as it removes incentives to drive the results and interpretation.

Why? Because with the acceptance of the Stage 1, journals commit to publish the final work (or Stage 2) regardless of the final outcomes.

Given that the HCPh is intended as a foundational reference dataset, it was crucial that the design itself was peer-reviewed.

Registered reports are not free of caveats.

With the communal improvement of scientific endeavors, we will be able to shorten the preparation time of pre-registered analysis and ensure that peer-review does not excessively delays the onset of data collection.

We are currently concluding the final Stage 2 reporting the results, to be submitted to the journal within the next 3-4 months.

We have collected and preprocessed a unique dataset and publicly released its comprehensive standard operating procedures.

Following our pre-registered commitments, we are currently executing our promised analysis involving principal components analyses of functional connectivity and bayesian modelling of structural connectivity.

Finally, we will investigate how structural and functional connectivity measurements agree if obtained with different devices.

This will yield a baseline measure of how stable connectivity metrics can be if the protocol is maximally controlled.

But the impact of HCPh goes far beyond the analyses committed within the Stage 1 report.

We hope to see new “human phantom” datasets at multiple sites, enabling direct cross-site calibration.

HCPh can also serve as ground truth data for AI-driven motion-correction algorithms, generative modeling, or even real-time scanning protocols.

Essentially, we’re complementing standardization efforts (like NiPreps) with a calibration resource that addresses test-retest and multi-site reproducibility.

In computational neuroscience I'm recognized by my standardization efforts.

NiPreps is a framework for standardized preprocessing pipelines in neuroimaging.

I often use the “sushi-grade” analogy

just like sushi-grade fish is minimally processed but safe to consume,

NiPreps yields “analysis-grade” data, with minimal processing interventions but ready for direct machine learning ingestion.

Here’s the basic architecture.

It’s an ecosystem of modular tools at different levels of abstraction, offering space for AI/ML innovation all accross individual computer vision tasks.

Beyond citations and the staggering usage figures I showed in my first presentation, NiPreps is a major achievement by DORA principles.

NiPreps is used in large consortia like ENIGMA, given a foundation to pioneering clinical applications such as Tozzi 2024, and is offered by major industry players like Flywheel, QMENTA, and even AWS workflows.


The NiPreps framework is driven by a community involving more than 100 scientist globally and their adoption continues growing.

That’s the real impact: it’s changing how people conduct imaging studies and ensuring higher data quality across labs.

One distinct reason for success is that we contributed to bridge the gap between research and real-world applicationi by reversing the typical knowledge transference flow:

We integrate software engineering best practices from devops and industry for the standardization and solidification of the neuroimaging workflow.

My second major achievement revolves around open science advocacy, training, and mentorship.

In practice, this means:

Contributing to over 2,000 code commits per year across more than 80 open repositories.

Embracing Registered Reports to ensure rigorous methodology and better research planification, as opposed to brute-force trial and error.

Indeed, registered reports will become central to prospectively implementing trustworthy and interpretable models, in contrast to retrospective assurance.

Organizing **hands-on training** like **NiPraxis** and the **CIBM/fMRIPrep Bootcamp** so newcomers can quickly adopt reproducible pipelines.

Leading **hackathons** and **BrainHacks** to foster a collaborative environment where diverse skill sets merge.

Finally, **mentorship** is key.

Through my **AxonLab research group** and broader community support, I help early-career scientists gain confidence and skill in open science practices.


(Actually, right after this interview, I’ll be heading to our PhD student Celine Provins’ public defense—an exciting milestone for our open-science journey!)
